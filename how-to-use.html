                <h3>Reading Approach</h3>
                <p>The texts can be read like other books, with flexibility to explore them in any order or across different sets. Students are encouraged to read with fluency and rhythm, developing natural and confident reading style. Each text is intentionally kept short to help students establish good reading habits.</p>

                <h3>Reinforcing Learning</h3>
                <p>Even if students memorise the content, instructors can strengthen learning by revisiting individual words. Isolating words and asking questions like, “What was this word?” supports long-term memory retention and reinforces vocabulary acquisition.</p>
